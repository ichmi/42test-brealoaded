ENEMYyyYyyYY:  \o/

[Intro: Dan Reynolds]
Look out for yourself

[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
...
